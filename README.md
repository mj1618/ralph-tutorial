# Ralph Demo

Using only what's in .scripts/ and .seed/ generated the `excel` branch which is an Excel clone in the browser.

# Prerequisites

- Node installed (to run the pretty-print script)
- Cursor agents cli installed and logged-in

## Steps to reproduce

1. Chuck `.seeds/1-plan.md` into cursor to generate the tasks
2. Run `./.scripts/ralph.sh` to run the Ralph loop
3. Let it run for as long as you want
4. Profit

## Example

The `excel` branch is an in-browser excel that was generated in an hour. It has simple functionality but it was on the right track had I let it burn through more tokens.
